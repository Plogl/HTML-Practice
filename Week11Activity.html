        <h3>What is a Binary Search Algorithm?</h3>
        <p>From <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_algorithm">Wikipedia</a>,
        A binary search tree, "In computer science, binary search, also known as half-interval search, logarithmic
        search, or binary chop, is a search algorithm that finds the positionof a target value within a sorted
        array. Binary  search compares the target value to the middle element of the array. If they are not equal, the
         half in which the target cannot lie is eliminated and the search continues on the remaining half, again taking 
         the middle element to compare to the target value, and repeating this until the target value is found. 
         If the search ends with the remaining half being empty, the target is not in the array. </p>
         <h3>Binary Search Algorithm Process</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Compare your value with the middle element of a sorted array</li>
            <li>Check if the value matches. If it matches, the value is found in the list</li>
            <li>If the values do not match, compare the values to find if the value is greater or lesser than
                the element
            </li>
            <li>If the value is greater, search through the top half of the tree, and if lesser, the bottom half 
                of the tree (excluding the original element)
            </li>
            <li>Continue this process until there is only one element remaining. If they are equal, the value is found.
                if not, the value does not exist in the list.
            </li>
         </ol>
